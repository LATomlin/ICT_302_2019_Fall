# What Is Being Done?

> My contribution to the CMS guidebook will come in the form of the admistrator position that I have assumed in the class. With this position I intend to ensure my peers and my partners and I accomplish our goals of making this book something that can help us in the future as well as potentially help the students who take this class in the future. 

# When Is It Being Done?

> I expect for all of my contributions to be taken place inside of our class periods. These will be the times that are easiest to speak to my fellow classmates and help them in any way as well as get my work done of making calendars to keep us on track. 

# How Will It Be Evaluated?

> The peer that will be grading me throughout the course is Tawn Dang. Tawn will be grading me on my ability to keep in contact with my fellow peers to make sure all of us stay on track, and keep a constent presentation of tasks that will need to be executed throughout the course. The way he can do this is by checking slack and click up to make sure I have been posting and keeping things up to date and to make sure I am talking to the other leaders I can keep a log. 

# Who Will Evaluate It?

> Again the person that can evaluate my work is Tawn Dang. I think Tawn would be a good person to do this because he isn't in the administrator group himself and as an outside perspective he will be able to help me see and understand more than just my groups concerns. Also with him being outside of the administrator perspective he can give a better idea about what other groups expect from us this way we can excute what every group needs us to.
