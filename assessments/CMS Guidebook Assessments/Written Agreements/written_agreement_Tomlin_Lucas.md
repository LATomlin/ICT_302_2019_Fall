# What Is Being Done?

As part of the Admin group I have been tasked mainly with being the person who continues to keep constant contact between the groups. I do this by not only physically talking to mainly the leaders of the groups but also trying to keep a line of communication in the chat application that we have all agreed to use, Slack. Lastly, part of my tasks as an admin is assigning people privlages and task within our class. 

# When Is It Being Done?
This will be done all throughout the class. Unfortunatley there is no specific time that I can give for when all of my task are due it is more based on when the other groups need things to be finished.

# How Will It Be Evaluated?

I should be evaluated on a few different things. </br>
Made sure there was ommunications with all groups each week: 4 points </br>
Made sure group leaders gave administrators tasks when needed: 2 points </br>
Made sure group tasks were assigned on ClickUp for each group assigned to me: 2 points </br>

# Who Will Evaluate It?

The best classmate for evaluating me would be Johnny. He is also an Administrator and understands what work each of us should be doing as well as what we should be doing as a collective. Having another Admin as the person who is evaluating me is the best option because we have more of a handle on what needs to be done for the rest of this class and this project.
