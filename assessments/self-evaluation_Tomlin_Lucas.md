# Course Objectives

Throughout the semester, the following “I can” statements have served as guiding objectives for this course. Now that we're at the end of the semester, you should feel comfortable making each statement about yourself and be able to back up that statement with your performance on course activities and assessments. Because of the important role that the CMS Guidebook has played in our course, and because of the unstructured nature of this assignment, please concentrate in particular on your contributions to that project as you evaluate yourself according to course objectives.

## I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

> Take a few minutes on what it means to identify and define key concepts in (web) content management and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below:

In my opinion to identify and define the key concepts of content management you have to go back to the beginning of class to remember at the roots what a CMS is. Seeing that the main purpose of a CMS is to essentially help members of the editorial team have an automated tool to control content by allowing creators to "control content"(Week 4 slides) which means that they can define what content put where and what order in which it is seen, "allow reuse of content"(Week 4 slides) which can in-part be considered keeping storage of your content but in most context means giving viewers multiple ways to see the content you find important more than once, "allow manipulation of content"(Week 4 slides) which means allowing the creators to revise content either if what they said has been outdated or if they change their mind of how they want their content to be seen, "increases efficiency of editors"(Week 4 slides) which means giving the ability to do everything mentioned above as well as assign certain task to make sure everything is done in the editorial process. These all of course have their own subset of different concepts that go into them but I would consider these the key concepts of content management and are important to making sure CMS's are functional. 

> Consider specific moments (such as interactions with Dr. Greenhalgh or your classmates) or activities (such as assessments you submitted or contribution you made to the CMS Guidebook) during the semester that would give some insight into your ability to identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. In the space below, identify at least two moments or activities and (for each) describe what they say about your ability to meet this course objective. Please be as specific as possible (such as quoting exact text from your learning journal, identifying an edit to the CMS Guidebook in WordPress, or quoting from a particular conversation in Slack).

I think one of the most important activities we did to grasp the majority of the key concepts of content management and CMS’s in general was working with github. Github does most of the functions that any average CMS by allowing you to control the content on your page, giving the user the option to reuse your content by filing it away in different folders named repositories, giving you the option to manipulate that content by giving you editing options and forking options that allow you to take an original post and editing it to your likings and sending a pull request to the original owner of the content. Github also gives one tools for editing in their website as well. Lastly, github makes the editing process more efficient by giving all of the mentioned above tools. Using those tools in an effective manor will make it an efficient way to help editors.  Another way we have learned the key concepts of content management was more specifically in class during the entire semester. I understand that this is very vague but the fact is that during the entire semester we would have at the very least one day where we learned a new concept that contributed to the key concepts of content management, starting out with learning how to create and manipulate content with text editors, all the way up to understanding what an RSS is and how it held content for you that you could later reuse if you needed a reference. It may sound like an easy way out of this question but I think that it was the main purpose of this class to learn the key concepts and the lectures along with Dr. Greenhalgh’s understanding and presentation of the key concepts on a week by week basis has helped me learn a great amount about the key concepts of content management. 

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

I think overall I would rate myself an 8 out of 8 on this subject. I am aware and understand the key concepts of content management as I’ve shown above and throughout the entirety of this course.  

## I can manage content using established workflows.

> Take a few minutes on what it means to manage content using established workflows and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below:

Established workflows are essentially to effectively making something especially when that something requires multiple groups working together to accomplish a goal. Throughout this course we learned the importance of the main roles in the building of a CMS being Editors, Site Designers, Developers, Administrators, and lastly the Stakeholders. Like we have discussed in class these aren’t one person per job roles but instead “hats” that one person can have multiple hats. Having groups in each of these roles though make it more critical to have an established workflow because there needs to be an understanding of who does what and in what order. This allows for continuity and even work distribution throughout the process.

Please be as specific as possible (such as quoting exact text from your learning journal, identifying an edit to the CMS Guidebook in WordPress, or quoting from a particular conversation in Slack).

The two most specific examples of established workflow that I can think of is, task assignment in ClickUp and group communication in Slack. Both of these applications were vital to us succeeding in the CMS guidebook and in the class. ClickUp was a place for everyone but more specifically the administrators to assign tasks to the other groups that was given by the group leaders of each respective group even after some of our groups were combined because of the size of the class. The nice thing about ClickUp is that you can set tasks for a certain time and date and add notes to the tasks. This also was nice because when the editors were finished with their tasks they could check them off allowing the site designers/ developers to start on their task. Slack was a great app because it allowed for constant communications with each of the groups separately as well as a general chat where all groups could communicate together.

Based on what I have shown above I would give myself an 8 of 8 in my ability to understand and define established workflows.

## I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

> Take a few minutes on what it means to identify and employ technologies related to content management and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below:

When considering the above topic of being able to employ technologies related to content management I think that this was seen throughout the course mostly in the form of different websites. One of the biggest examples of this was obviously WordPress where we were able to do all of the processes of a CMS on one site but this was also seen in the editing and manipulation side when looking at Hugo and then all processes again while working with Github. All of these sites allowed for at the very least some portion of the process of working with CMS’s as they are applied to technology. With this we also needed to consider how the content was aggregated and viewed and if it was going to be used more on one type of technology over the other, such as a website being used more on a mobile device rather than a computer.

Please be as specific as possible (such as quoting exact text from your learning journal, identifying an edit to the CMS Guidebook in WordPress, or quoting from a particular conversation in Slack).

The biggest example for me during the semester of technology in respect to CMS’s is from Github. I say this because I was an administrator and up until the end of the semester I didn’t have editing or designing privilege of that website but I did use multiple technologies with consideration of Github such as atom.io and github desktop app. These apps and learning how to code in these apps forced me to consider how they were viewed, how I could edit the text, and how I could store and reuse the content. As mentioned in the above key concept of the class this wouldn’t be possible without some kind of established workflow for myself and the main app I mainly used to keep myself on track was ClickUp. I used this app to set tasks for myself to remind me what I had to do and when I had to do said tasks. 

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.tt

Based on what I’ve mentioned above, I would give myself a 7 out of 8 on this section just because I know github is a debatable CMS and I would have loved to get more editing and designing experience with WordPress.

## I can find and use resources for self-directed learning

> Take a few minutes on what it means to find and use resources for self-directed learning and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below:

This class, although it was heavily centered on CMS’s and how the functioned, was very much based on self-exploration of different resources and how to find tools to make our lives easier and more efficient. The CMS guidebook itself is a major example of that because we made it in the thought process of, “If I wanted to know what to do with, and how to make and use a CMS how would I do it?” This along with the fact that we were heavily encouraged to use our team members as well as other outside resources to answer questions we had was the reason I think self-directed learning was one of the major concepts of this class. I feel that this class encouraged me to look for topics I was interested in up to try and learn more about them.

Please be as specific as possible (such as quoting exact text from your learning journal, identifying an edit to the CMS Guidebook in WordPress, or quoting from a particular conversation in Slack).

One of the biggest things we did consistently all semester was keep a learning journal and in this journal we were encouraged to look outside the class to research further topics that we discussed during the week. This learning journal alone has countless links that were different sites that helped me further my knowledge on what we were talking about in class, my general interest combined with the tools I’ve learned from ICT 200 and ICT 201 helped me get results that I will use as resources even after I graduate to continue to learn about different subjects that we talked about in class. One of the major links/websites that I have used more than once over the semester is https://www.w3schools.com/ which helps people learn multiple different coding languages and is almost the definition of self-directed learning.  

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

I would give myself an 8 out of 8 on my ability to do self-directed learning based off of my answers above. 

## I can describe and compare content management systems.

> Take a few minutes on what it means to describe and compare content management systems and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below:

Throughout this course content management systems have been obviously the main topic. We mainly worked with WordPress we also worked a lot with Hugo and Github(debatably a CMS). Personally a CMS wasn’t the easiest to define because what makes a CMS is shown in part of a lot of different websites. From my understanding a CMS is a place where you can edit, store, and create an environment for people of a content creation process to congregate.  

> Consider specific moments (such as interactions with Dr. Greenhalgh or your classmates) or activities (such as assessments you submitted or contribution you made to the CMS Guidebook) during the semester that would give some insight into your ability to describe and compare content management systems. In the space below, identify at least two moments or activities and (for each) describe what they say about your ability to meet this course objective. Please be as specific as possible (such as quoting exact text from your learning journal, identifying an edit to the CMS Guidebook in WordPress, or quoting from a particular conversation in Slack).

A specific time I remember using a CMS was with Wordpress, although I didn’t necessarily edit or create content on Wordpress some of my fellow classmates showed me the process of them doing it and it gave me the insight of the details that come along with Wordpress especially the difference in post and pages being one as more word based and the respective other more visual based. The other (debatable) CMS that I was familiar with was Github in my experience Github did almost everything that Wordpress did but also gave the function of holding different CMS’s such as hugo and even Wordpress themes and templates on them. In my opinion Github is a more useful tool for storing content as well and the only thing it lacked it the extensive use of CSS for visual addition.

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

Based on what I’ve said above I would rate myself a 7 out of 8 because I would like to be able to draw a more solid line in between a website and a CMS.

# Final Grade

> Add together your 0-8 ratings to get a final, overall rating between 0-40. Write that number below, and provide an overall summary of why you think this number reflects your performance in this class.

I would give myself a 38 out of 40 for my self evaluation. I think this is an appropriate grade because I understand the vast majority of the key concepts in this class but I understand there are still some things I need to work on if I want to continue my education and understanding of CMS’s.
