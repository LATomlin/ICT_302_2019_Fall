# What Changes Did You Make?

During the tinkering in week four and five the two changes I am most proud of are 1. putting the entirety of the Titanic script within his "about me" page. And 2. changing the font size to a point where they were stacked on top of eachother and you could see nothing else. These were funny but they also helped to show how little things can be changed to make large differences. Two things I wanted to figure out how to do but did not understand is changing the picture at the begining of the page and how to change the small icons. I will continue to tinker until I understand how to do that. 

# What Did You Learn?

One big thing I learned was how important templates are. Templating is an effective way to save some time when making post or pages that are going to be similar multiple times. Also templating helps if a mistake is made you will have a checkpoint to start from instead of restarting the entire code.
